Processing an image of coins

This program reads the image of coins and removes the salt and pepper noise in the image. It compares two image segmentation algorithms and it 
segments the coins. Since the segmentations is done, it outputs a new image containing (a) only the coins which overlap or touch each other and 
(b) only non-overlapping coins. Furthermore, it shows an overlay of bounding boxes of each coin found and it calculates the total amount of money 
in the picture.
